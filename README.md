# Firefly-EKS
# Creating an EKS Cluster with Node Group

This Terraform code creates an EKS cluster with a node group in a new VPC with two public subnets in the `us-east-1` region. 

The VPC, subnets, and internet gateway are defined in `vpc.tf`. The EKS cluster and IAM roles are defined in `eks.tf`. The EKS node group and IAM roles are defined in `node_group.tf`. 

To create the EKS cluster and node group, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the EKS cluster and node group are created, you can configure `kubectl` to connect to the cluster using the following command:

```
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name eks_cluster --region us-east-1
```

Example output:

```
Outputs:

eks_cluster_endpoint = "https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.gr7.us-east-1.eks.amazonaws.com"
eks_cluster_name = "eks_cluster"
node_group_ami_id = "ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
node_group_instance_type = "t2.small"
node_group_security_group_id = "sg-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
node_group_subnet_ids = [
  "subnet-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "subnet-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
]
